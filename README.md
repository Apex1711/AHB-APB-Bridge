# AHB-APB-Bridge
This project focuses on the design and implementation of an AHB (Advanced High-performance Bus) to APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) bridge. The AHB-APB bridge is a crucial component in System-on-Chip (SoC) designs, enabling seamless communication between the high-speed AHB and the lower-speed APB subsystems.
